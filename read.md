    The web app contains a login with email and password using jwt and bycrpt, google signin , a vote creator and a vote , each
    route is protected by the back end so any body cannot just visit.

    When you login you get to verify your email with instant otp , there is also forgot password route , login sign in,

    you also get welcome email to your inbox.

    Taught Process

    Create and store the user data on mongo db using jwt or google signin

    create a dashbord that leads to Vote creating page , on going vote and vote viewer.

    the each user per vote was going to be well implemented using browser finger printing so

    only one device can vote, email if signed in and storing cookies in local storage.

    I could use ip address but ip address changes all the time and if two device are on the same wifi , almost

    all users cannot vote since they are sharing the same ip .
